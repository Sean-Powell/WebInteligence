[{"content": " The IETF meetings tend to become too large, creating logistics and planning problems.\n            I suggest that future meetings are held for two weeks, with applications and user services issues the first week, and all other issues the second week.\n            Those who so wish could attend both weeks, and other people could attend only one week.\n            Those who choose to attend both weeks would be able to cover more groups and do better liaisons between the different areas.\n            The Friday of the first week could discuss applications issues which might be of special interest to the other areas, and the Monday of the second week would schedule other groups which might be of special interest to applications people, so some people could attend Monday-Monday or Friday-Friday.\n            ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Jacob Palme &lt;jpalme@dsv.su.se&gt; (Stockholm University and KTH)\n

some time to say hi.\n            The nitty-gritty...\n            Meeting registration is open from now until 1 October.\n            register via the meeting page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 which also provides details on location, accommodation, etc.\n            There are a limited number of rooms available in the Royal Sonesta Hotel (which is the meeting venue) at a discounted rate\n            - in order to qualify for this rate reservations and meeting registration must be completed by September 10.\n            Since October is the peak season for Boston hotels, rooms are expensive and hotels book out early, so you are advised to make your plans and reservations as soon as possible.\n            If you have any questions or special requirements please contact me as early as possible.\n            Cheers\n            Charles McCN\n\t    --Charles McCathieNevile mailto:charles@w3.org\n            phone: +1 617 258 0992

important - if you haven't registered yet, don't forget.\n            http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 for the details.\n            Given that there are a small number of us, I thought I would ask what people want to eat for lunch.\n            The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille.\n            Possible substitutions:\n            baked Scrod (fish)\n            chicken caesar salad\n            hommus roll-up sandwich with salad\n            salad with crab cakes\n            churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions\n            I will do this in the following way:\n            If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear.\n            It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do.\n            The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday.\n            No response will not be considered a vote for the default\n            - it will be considered a vote for &quot;whatever gets chosen&quot;\n            Sorry to bore you with administrivia, but I figure that having food that people like helps the meeting go well...\n            cheers\n            Charles McCN\n            --Charles McCathieNevile mailto:charles@w3.org\n            phone: +1 617 258 0992

need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general)\n            + Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do)\n            + Things which are good to do although they

checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the

at all and absolutely love it.\n            it's more a Find function then a 'cycling through links' function.\n            with the focus on the page you just type a word (or beginning of it) and mozilla jumps to that word.\n            F3 finds the next instance.\n            it first only looks at links but if you type a '/' (slash) before the word it searches the whole text.\n            it really just saves you bringing up that cumbersome Find dialogue box.\n            i don't think it really works for cycling through links.\n            the tab key works better for that.\n
